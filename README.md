# Project-on-Life-Expectancy-Analysis
Life expectancy refers to the number of years a person is expected to live based on the statistical average. It depends on the geographical context of the area. Before the modernization of the world, life expectancy was around 30 years in all parts of the world. Life expectancy increased at the beginning of the 19th century but until there are the same countries while it remains low in the rest of the world.
This shows that health standards are not the same all over the world. In the 20th century, this global inequality is reduced and similarly, life expectancy is approaching 70 to 75 years and similarly no country in the world today has a low life expectancy than countries with high life expectancy in 1800.

In the section below, I will take you through a Data Science Project on Life Expectancy Analysis with Python. The good thing about this task is that here you will learn about the factors that WHO uses to calculate the Life Expectancy of a country as the data is provided by WHO.
